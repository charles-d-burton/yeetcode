I was messing around with some our stupid system to deploy changes.  We had a really old system based on a dead version of Unix and our configuration management was some ancient version of RCS.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure that nobody had used it in ages or made changes of any kind because what happened was me being a new hotshit member of the team.  I thought it would be helpful to add the ability for every machine on our network to have the ability to use <code>bash</code> instead of only <code>tcsh</code> and <code>csh</code>.  I made a change to the <code>/etc/shells</code> file in the RCS repo and distributed it.  Little did I know that the telemetry input boxes were reading from that file to get their shell and their bootcode.
